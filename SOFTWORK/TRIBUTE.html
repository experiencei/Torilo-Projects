     </h3>
     <p>After Kuti and his band returned to Nigeria,
          the group was renamed (the) Afrika '70, as lyrical themes changed from love to social issues.
          He formed the Kalakuta Republic—a commune, a recording studio, and a home—for the many people connected to the band that he later declared independent from the Nigerian state. According to Lindsay Barrett, 
          the name "Kalakuta" is derived from the infamous Black Hole of Calcutta dungeon in India. </p>
